                   <h4>A little bit about me</h4>
                   <p>I am called Louise Demarillac Izere,I live in Gisenyi and am a highschool graduate super excited to be studying about coding at Moringa school.
                       <br>Despite growing up with little access to technological devices,I always wanted to know how computers and different online platforms worked and dreamed that one day I will create my own platform, that made me choose to study computer science in my A-level and the WeCode program at Moringa school was the perfect opportunity for me to finally live my dream and get proffessional skills.
                   </p>
                   <p>Thanks to WeCode Program , my web develpment skills have truly increased !</p>
